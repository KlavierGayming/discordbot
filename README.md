# Simple (currently music-centered) discord bot with queueing.
Idk what else to say here. It's like literally what i just told you.
**This is kinda *bo***ring
idk what else to put here actually
spent like 3 days making this

Also to run this, you will need `discord.py`, `ytdl-patched` and `ffmpeg` and you will need to create a `token.json` file with the contents being:
`
{ 
    "token": "your bot token",
    "prefix": "prefix"
}`
